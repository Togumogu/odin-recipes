        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Inspired by the shoyu ramen at my favorite ramen restaurant, this is my ideal ramen. If you want to make it pescatarian, I suggest foregoing the pork belly for bonito flakes -- just a big pinch in each bowl.</p>
        <p>Simply put, ramen is a Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles (exclude seasoning packet)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons onion powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground ginger</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Cook noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir garlic powder, onion powder, and ginger into the noodles and water; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Eat!</li>
        </ol>
